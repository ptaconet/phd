How can we **predict where and when people are likely to contract malaria in a near future** `r emo::ji("mosquito")` `r emo::ji("sun")` `r emo::ji("rain")`  ? 

How can we make the **results of these predictions easily accessible to anyone**, including the authorities in charge of malaria prevention ? 

Through a series of vignettes, we propose a transparent, reproducible and as much as possible reusable method to model the risk of residual malaria transmission at a micro-scale and communicate the predictions. Our study areas are two distinct 2500 km^2^ wide rural regions of Western Africa. We use epidemiological, entomological and sociological data collected during the 3 years-long [REACT](https://burkina-faso.ird.fr/la-recherche/projets-de-recherche2/gestion-de-la-resistance-aux-insecticides-au-burkina-faso-et-en-cote-d-ivoire-recherche-sur-les-strategies-de-lutte-anti-vectorielle-react) project over these two areas, in conjunction with environmental data mostly free of charge and available at global scale. 

Our work uses exclusively free and open source softwares/libraries. All the scripts are developed using the R programming language and rely on many, many packages developed by the huge R community. We attempt to develop generic scripts (e.g. land cover mapping, extraction of spatial-temporal environmental data at sampling points) that can be reused in various contexts, so do not hesitate to have a look at the vignettes even if you are not working in the public health research field ! 

Our vignettes : 

- [*Land cover mapping at different nomenclature levels built on a combined random forest and object based image analysis approach using multisource data (HRS, VHRS and DEM)*](https://github.com/ptaconet/r_react/blob/master/workflow_object_based_data_analysis.R)  TODO rmd ...
- [*Automatic import of spatial-temporal environmental data and extraction within buffers around sampling points*](https://ptaconet.github.io/malamodpkg/articles/import_tidy_transform_envdata.html)

This work is part of my PhD project realized at the [MIVEGEC](https://www.mivegec.ird.fr/en/) unit of the [French Research Institute for Sustainable Development](https://en.ird.fr/).
