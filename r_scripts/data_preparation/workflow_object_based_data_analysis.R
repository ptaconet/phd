## ideas for further improvements: run classification n times (e.g. 15 times), not only 1 time, to improve overall classif stats

#### Important information
# The script takes as input a Very high resolution image of the area of interesed (Spot 6/7) + the Copernicus scihub identifiers of a High resolution image (Sentinel 2) + a learning/validation ground truth dataset, enventually with a class hierarchical structure.
# It performs all the pre-processing, data preparation, classification and post-processing steps. Details are provided below.
# The script uses various R packages (see section "prepare workflow" for a list of packages used) and open-source libraries that are called through R : the Orfeo Toolbox v6.6.1 (https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/), the GRASS library v7.4 (https://grass.osgeo.org), the GDAL library v2.2.1 (https://www.gdal.org/) and SAGA GIS v2.3.1 (http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html). In addition, the workflow uses a personal release of the Orfeo Toolbox for the segmentation process (since no relevant application was found in the official OTB release for the segmentation of very large images using the Baatz and Shape Generic Region Merging algorithm). The release was generated and kindly provided by Rafaelle Gaetano. It is available here: http://napoli.teledetection.fr/logiciels/otb_moringa_build_win_x64.zip
# The methodology used in this workflow was inspired from these two articles and uses an R package developed in the frame of the Gavish et al. article (unfortunataly neither available on a git repository nor on the CRAN) (with minor adaptations for this workflow):

#### Workflow steps :
### Step 1 - Download the Digital Elevation Model (SRTM tiles) for the ROI
### Step 2 - Download the ancillary data :
## 2.1 - Download the HRS Sentinel 2 image(s) from the Copernicus scihub
### Step 3 - Pre-process the VHRS Spot6/7 image(s) :
## 3.1 - fusion the tiles of the panchromatic image
## 3.2 - convert the multispectral and panchromatic images from digital numbers to TOA reflectance
## 3.3 - orthorectify the multispectral and panchromatic images
## 3.4 - extract the ROI
## 3.5 - pansharpen the MS image using the PAN image
## 3.6 - mosaic the various tiles covering the ROI (if relevant)
### Step 4 - Preprocess the ancillary data :
## 4.1 - preprocess the DEM : mosaic the various tiles covering the ROI (if relevant), and then extract the ROI
## 4.2 - preprocess the Sentinel 2 image(s) : mosaic the various images covering the ROI (if relevant), and then extract the ROI
### Step 5 - Prepare the data for the classification :
## 5.1 - extract ancillary indices from the DEM : slope, aspect, flow accumulation, flow direction, topographic convergence index
## 5.2 - extract textural indices from the Spot6/7 panchromatic image at various moving windows sizes
## 5.3 - extract radiometric indices from the Spot6/7 pansharpened image
## 5.4 - extract radiometric indices from the S2 image
## 5.5 - Split the bands of the Spot6/7 image
### Step 6 - Segment the Spot6/7 image using the Baatz and Shape Generic Region Merging algorithm
### Step 7 - Extract the zonal statistics (reflectance, spectral indices, textural indices, ancillary, shape, contextual)
## 7.1 - Extract zonal statistics for the ground truth dataset
## 7.2 - Extract zonal statistics for the segmented objects dataset
### Step 8 - Prepare classification : generate a set of random forest classifiers using the training dataset with two approaches: i) a flat classification approach, ii) a class hierarchical structure approach. Classify the objects output of the segmentation process using the approach that gives the best results
## 8.1 - Generate the RF classifiers at each class hierarchical level using i) a flat approach, ii) a hierarchical approach, and compare the results
## 8.2 - Get useful information on the classification (discriminant variables, etc.) considering the class hierarchical structure
### Step 9 - Classify
## 9.1 - Classify the objects output of the segmentation using the approach that gives the best results
## 9.2 - Save the classification as GIS data in various formats (vector and raster)
## 9.3 - Add user criterions to enhance the classification

### Parameters for step 8
column_names_lc_classes_hierarchy<-c("L1","L2","L3","L4","L5") #<Names of the columns of land cover classes in the ground truth dataset. eg : c("L1","L2"). Typically L1 is the most aggregated land cover, L2 is a less aggregated classification, etc.>

### Parameters for step 9
process_cloudy_areas<-TRUE  # What to do with clouds and cloud shadows in Spot 6 images ? If FALSE will act as there were no clouds, hence, will classify cloud areas wrongly. If TRUE, cloud and cloud shadow data must be available in the training/validation dataset. Cloud will be detected with the RF model and primitives corresponding to the parcels classified as clouds will be set to NA. Then RF will be re-run. Hence the parcels will be classified base on the S2 image only.
# BF:FALSE ; CIV:TRUE

### For the hierarchical classification, uses the package HieRanFor developed by Dr Yoni Gavish. The package is neither available on a Git repository nor on the CRAN. It was downloaded from https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0924271617303696-mmc5.zip and manually installed
## This package uses the R package RandomForest to classify the dataset using Random Forest classifiers.
